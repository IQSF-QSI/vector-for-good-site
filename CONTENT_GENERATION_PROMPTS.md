You are writing a LinkedIn post for Vector for Good that challenges industry conventional wisdom.

POSITION: [Contrarian / Devil's Advocate / Uncomfortable Truth]

POST GOAL: Drive comments and debate, position as independent thinker

---

POST REQUIREMENTS:

**1. HOOK (Controversy Formula):**

"Unpopular opinion: [Controversial statement that challenges mainstream view]"

"Everyone's wrong about [topic]. Here's why:"
"I'm about to piss off every [industry role], but someone needs to say this:"

Examples:
- "Unpopular opinion: Your DEI training is making things worse."
- "Hot take: The ESG industry is a compliance theater scam."
- "Everyone's wrong about AI bias. The problem isn't the data—it's the architecture."

---

- ✅ Be intellectually honest (acknowledge valid counterpoints)
- ✅ Propose better solution (not just criticism)
- ❌ Punch down (don't attack vulnerable groups)
- ❌ Be controversial for clicks (substance over shock)
- ❌ Make unfalsifiable claims
- ❌ Personal attacks on individuals/companies

---

**4. VOICE & TONE:**
- Confident but not arrogant ("Here's what I believe" not "I'm right, you're wrong")
- Data-driven (back opinions with evidence)
- Respectful of disagreement (genuinely want debate)
- Clear about what you're challenging
- Example: "I get why people love annual DEI surveys. They're easy to measure. But here's the problem: by the time you see the data, your best LGBTQ+ talent has already left."

---

**5. ENGAGEMENT MAXIMIZATION:**
- Ask for counterarguments (drives comments)
- Tag thought leaders who might disagree (respectfully)
- Use phrases like:
  * "Change my mind"

---

**7. RISK MITIGATION:**
- Don't attack specific companies by name
- Acknowledge good-faith efforts even if you disagree with approach
