## TEMPLATE 1: TechCrunch (AI/Technology Angle)

**Subject Line:** Guest Post Pitch: The AI Bias Problem in LGBTQ+ Safety Tech

**Email Body:**

Hi [Editor Name],

I'm Levi Hankins, Founder & CEO of Vector for Good, a NVIDIA Inception company building the first quantifiable LGBTQ+ safety intelligence platform for enterprises.

I'd like to pitch a guest post for TechCrunch on a critical but underreported issue: **how single-LLM AI systems fail at LGBTQ+ context—and what we built to solve it.**

**Why this matters for TechCrunch readers:**

- AI bias isn't abstract—it has real-world safety consequences for LGBTQ+ employees in 72 countries where being queer is criminalized
- Our 4-LLM "Queer Intelligence" system represents a novel approach to context-aware AI (GPT-5, Claude-4, Gemini-2.5 Pro + specialized models)
- Fortune 50 companies are using this tech to reduce safety incidents by 92% and save $2.4M-$8.7M annually
- We're backed by NVIDIA Inception and have 5+ years of unique training data from the International Queer Safety Foundation

**Proposed article:** "Why Single-LLM AI Can't Understand LGBTQ+ Context (And What We Built Instead)"

**Key Points:**
1. The training data bias problem in mainstream AI
2. How cultural nuance and legal complexity require multi-model architecture
3. Technical deep-dive: Our 4-LLM relay system
4. Real-world impact: Fortune 50 case studies
5. The future of context-aware AI for marginalized communities

**My credentials:**
- Founder & CEO, Vector for Good (NVIDIA Inception)
- Built world's first quantifiable LGBTQ+ safety intelligence platform
- Founded International Queer Safety Foundation (IQSF) - world's largest LGBTQ+ safety dataset
- Trusted by Fortune 50 companies for ESG reporting

Would you be interested in this piece? I can deliver 1,200-1,500 words with original data, technical diagrams, and exclusive case study insights.

I'm also happy to adjust the angle based on what resonates most with TechCrunch's audience.

Best,

## TEMPLATE 2: Forbes (Business/ESG Angle)

**Subject Line:** Guest Contributor Pitch: Solving the Unmeasurable "S" in ESG

**Email Body:**

Hi [Editor Name],

I'm reaching out to pitch a guest contribution for Forbes on a $63 billion problem in the ESG investment market: **the "S" (Social) in ESG has been unmeasurable—until now.**

89% of institutional investors report that social impact data is unreliable or unauditable (MSCI, 2024). This puts billions at risk and undermines the credibility of every ESG claim.

**Why Forbes readers care:**

- The SEC is proposing mandatory social impact disclosure rules (expected Q2 2025)
- EU's CSRD already requires quantifiable social metrics
- Investors managing $35 trillion in ESG assets are demanding better data
- Companies without measurement infrastructure will scramble when enforcement begins

**My unique angle:**

As Founder & CEO of Vector for Good (NVIDIA Inception member), I built the first platform for quantifiable LGBTQ+ workplace safety metrics—solving what investors call "the unmeasurable 'S' problem."

Our Fortune 50 clients now report:
- 92% reduction in safety incidents
- $2.4M-$8.7M annual savings
- 35% ESG score improvements
- First-ever auditable social impact data for board presentations

**Proposed article:** "How to Measure the 'Unmeasurable S' in ESG: A Blueprint for Quantifiable Social Impact"

**Key Sections:**
1. Why the "S" has remained unmeasurable (and why that's a crisis)
2. The regulatory shift: SEC and EU CSRD requirements
3. What quantifiable social metrics actually look like (with data)
4. The first-mover advantage for companies implementing now
5. A roadmap for enterprises to become compliance-ready

**My background:**
- Founder & CEO, Vector for Good (Public Benefit Corporation)
- NVIDIA Inception Program member
- Founded International Queer Safety Foundation (501c3)
- 10% of company revenue funds grassroots LGBTQ+ advocacy
- Trusted by Fortune 50 enterprises for ESG reporting

I can deliver 1,000-1,200 words with original research, Fortune 50 case data, and actionable insights for C-suite executives.

Would this be a fit for Forbes' ESG or Leadership section?

Best regards,
Levi Hankins

P.S. - We also have compelling data on the $150M liability exposure companies face from inadequate LGBTQ+ workforce protection—happy to explore that angle as well.

**Subject Line:** Guest Article: The $135M Talent Retention Crisis Hidden in LGBTQ+ Attrition Data

**Email Body:**

- Cost to replace one senior employee: $50K-$200K

- Companies with quantifiable safety intelligence reduce attrition by 47%

5. 90-day action plan for CHROs

**My credentials:**

## TEMPLATE 6: Harvard Business Review (Strategy/Leadership Angle)

**Subject Line:** Article Proposal: How Quantifiable Social Impact Became a Competitive Advantage

**Email Body:**

Dear HBR Editorial Team,

I'm proposing an article for Harvard Business Review on a strategic shift happening in Fortune 50 enterprises: **companies that can quantify social impact are gaining measurable competitive advantages in talent, capital, and market valuation.**

**The thesis:**

For decades, "social impact" meant good PR. Now it's becoming a strategic asset—but only for companies with quantifiable metrics.

**Why this matters:**
- Investors managing $35 trillion demand measurable ESG data
- SEC proposing mandatory social impact disclosure (2025)
- Companies with strong "S" metrics outperform peers by 5.8% annually (MSCI)
- Talent wars: Gen Z won't work for companies without demonstrable values

**My unique contribution:**

As Founder & CEO of Vector for Good, I've helped Fortune 50 companies implement the first quantifiable LGBTQ+ safety metrics—turning what was once "soft" DEI into hard business advantage.

**Case evidence:**
- Client A: $50M+ valuation premium from ESG score improvement
- Client B: 47% reduction in talent attrition = $135M savings
- Client C: Won $200M+ contract due to superior ESG metrics

**Proposed article structure:**

1. **The Strategic Shift:** From "nice to have" to competitive necessity
2. **Why Measurement Matters:** Only what's measured improves
3. **The First-Mover Advantage:** Companies defining the standard vs. chasing it
4. **Implementation Framework:** How to build social impact measurement infrastructure
5. **ROI Evidence:** Quantifiable benefits across talent, capital, and operations
6. **Looking Ahead:** Mandatory disclosure and the companies that will thrive

**My background:**
- Founder & CEO, Vector for Good (Public Benefit Corporation)
- NVIDIA Inception Program
- Founded International Queer Safety Foundation
- Fortune 50 client roster
- Subject matter expert: ESG strategy, social impact measurement

I can deliver 2,000-2,500 words with original case data, frameworks, and actionable insights for C-suite leaders.

Would this align with HBR's strategic management coverage?

Sincerely,
Levi Hankins
Founder & CEO, Vector for Good
