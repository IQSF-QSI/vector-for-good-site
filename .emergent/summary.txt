The AI engineer's work pivoted from core application development to a comprehensive SEO and content strategy for Vector for Good. Initially, the AI addressed UI fixes and created initial blog and privacy policy pages. A significant challenge was the generation of AI-powered blog content, which was initially too slow, leading to the implementation of a faster seeding mechanism for sample posts. The focus then shifted entirely to implementing a detailed SEO strategy: adding meta tags, structured data (Organization, FAQ schema), optimizing images with alt text, and refining hero section messaging. The founder's name was also corrected in the schema. Finally, the AI generated detailed strategic documents for ongoing content production, guest outreach, and Google Search Console management, establishing a robust roadmap for future growth and authority building. The work highlights a transition from feature development to strategic marketing infrastructure.
