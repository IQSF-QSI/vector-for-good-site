The AI engineer successfully transformed the Vector for Good application from initial landing pages into a sophisticated, multi-faceted platform. This involved developing a new Corporate Traveler companion app with a full-stack architecture (React/FastAPI/Supabase), featuring JWT authentication and AI-powered safety analysis. A key enhancement was the functional KIKI QI AI assistant, integrating Cal.com for appointments and OpenPhone for human connection. The frontend received significant attention for mobile responsiveness, UI readability, and card styling fixes. Architecturally, a major undertaking was migrating the backend from MongoDB to Supabase. The development process was highly iterative, addressing user feedback, resolving compilation errors, and incorporating various third-party services. The project concluded with the user requesting new features: a comprehensive blog and detailed privacy policies, which are the immediate next tasks.

Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with and partially completed fixing styling issues across the application's cards. The user provided a screenshot specifically highlighting cramped metric boxes and general layout problems within the case study cards. The engineer created a new CSS file (), imported it into , and edited it to address these issues. The work was interrupted by new user requests before full verification of the card fixes could be presented.

The system is currently in a state where a robust Corporate Travel application has been integrated, featuring a dedicated landing page, authentication, mock booking, and AI safety analysis. The KIKI QI assistant is fully functional, supporting chat, appointment booking via Cal.com, and human connection via OpenPhone. The main landing pages (Enterprise, Community) have received significant enhancements including new content sections and mobile responsiveness with a hamburger menu. The backend has undergone a migration to Supabase, with client configurations and schema definition completed, but the full data migration and integration of Supabase into the application's logic (beyond initial setup) is part of upcoming tasks.
